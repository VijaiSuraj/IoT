# Factory Emissions Alarm
You own a factory. The factory produces toxic gases everyday which get filtered
before being released into the
atmosphere. But, to be on the safer side,
you wish to have an alerting system,
which alerts your employees if the work
place is polluted.
Design a circuit using 3 arduino
connected via I2C(1 master 2 slaves)
which helps serve your needs.

 ● Master : LED and Buzzer which alerts your employees
 ● Slave 1 : Gas sensor to sense the quality of air.
 ● Slave 2 : Ultrasonic sensor which senses the presence of an employee
approaching the affected area.

● If the air quality is poor, the alarm(Buzzer +LED) should go off when an
employee approaches the workplace (Ultrasonic sensor)
