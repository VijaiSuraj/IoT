# High Striker
You go to a fair and want to play High-striker
(strongman game). But just before your turn, the game
malfunctions. To fix this, you have to Design a circuit
using Arduino and force sensor that imitates the game.

● The output should have a series of LEDs that
glow up according to the amount of force that is
applied.

● When maximum force is applied, a buzzer
should ring
Bonus : Try using a neopixel LED strip and make it
glow when maximum force is applied.
