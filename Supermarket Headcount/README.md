# Supermarket Headcount
You own a supermarket and you want to have a device which can tell you the
number of people in the store at any given moment. So, you decide to design a
circuit using Arduino, PIR sensors and an
LCD screen.
● Two PIR sensors are required, one at
the entrance of the supermarket and
one at its exit.
● Print the number of shoppers on the
LCD screen
